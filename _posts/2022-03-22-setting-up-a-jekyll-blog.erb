Here's the thing I found about setting up a Jekyll blog or anything, really--you will run into some issue like a missing file. And sometimes, instructions can get far ahead that they miss out some small details.

Now, I've followed the instruction in [David's Blog](https://dfederm.com/creating-a-blog-using-github-pages/) up until the part where you specify in the `Gemfile` which dependencies from Ruby do you want to include. The `Gemfile` is missing.
